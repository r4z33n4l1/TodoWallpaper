1. Open the Shortcuts app on your iPhone
2. Create a new shortcut with these actions:

Find Latest Photo where:
- Album is "TodoWallpaper"
- Sort by Latest
- Limit is 1

Set Wallpaper where:
- Use Found Photo
- Set as Lock Screen

3. Export the shortcut
4. Replace this file with the exported .shortcut file

Note: The actual .shortcut file is a binary file that needs to be created on an iOS device using the Shortcuts app.
